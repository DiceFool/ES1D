# ES1D

An electrostatic 1D particle-in-cell (PIC) code. The code is based on [work done by Lubos Brieda](https://www.particleincell.com/2015/two-stream-instability/) in Javascript, however it has been converted to both Matlab and C++. 

The Matlab script, tested in MATLAB R2016a, produces graphical output which is saved as a GIF file (below). The C++ program, developed in Visual Studio 2015, produces no graphical output, and represents a first attempt at creating an "object-oriented" style C++ program (i.e. it is more complicated than it needs to be!).
